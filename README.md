# Ballena Project

This project was developed as part of the final assignment for the JavaScript course offered by Coderhouse.

The aim of this project is to create a furniture store website where users can browse through various furniture products, filter them by categories, and add them to a shopping cart.



## Description

Dalva Skin is a website designed for a furniture store. The user can see all the products in the store, filter them by category and add them to the shopping cart where the quantities can be modified. Here the user can also empty the cart or place the order.

## Technologies Used

- HTML and CSS: HTML5 and CSS3 were used to structure and design the different pages and elements of the site.

- SASS: SASS was implemented for better organization and maintainability of the CSS code.

- Git and GitHub: Git version control and the GitHub platform were used for collaborative development and source code management.

- Responsive Design: the website was designed and developed using responsive design techniques to ensure an optimal experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

- SEO (Search Engine Optimization): SEO practices were applied to improve the site's visibility in search engine results.

- Bootstrap: the Bootstrap framework was used to streamline development and ensure consistency in the design and structure of the site.

- Toastify and SweetAlert: These JavaScript libraries were integrated for creating popup notifications and attractive alert messages, respectively. 

- LocalStorage: utilize LocalStorage to store data locally in the user's browser. 

- Fetch API: employed the Fetch API to handle asynchronous HTTP requests. This allowed me to fetch data from a JSON file that contains detailed information about the products available in the furniture store.
